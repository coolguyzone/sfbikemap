Technical Specification: San Francisco Bicycle Directions App with Elevation Tolerance
1. Introduction
This document outlines the technical specifications for a web-based application designed to provide bicycle directions within San Francisco. The primary distinguishing feature of this application will be its ability to allow users to specify their tolerance for elevation gain, thereby generating alternative routes that cater to different preferences for hilliness.

2. Goals
To provide accurate and efficient bicycle directions within San Francisco.

To empower users to customize routes based on their preferred elevation gain.

To offer a user-friendly interface for inputting origin/destination and adjusting elevation tolerance.

To leverage the Google Maps Platform APIs for routing, mapping, and elevation data.

3. Key Features
3.1. Core Functionality
Origin and Destination Input: Users can input start and end points for their bicycle journey via search boxes (autocomplete enabled).

Map Display: An interactive map displaying San Francisco, with the ability to pan, zoom, and show routing.

Bicycle Route Generation: Displaying one or more optimized bicycle routes between the origin and destination.

Elevation Tolerance Slider/Input: A UI element allowing users to select their desired level of elevation gain tolerance (e.g., "Least Hilly," "Moderate," "Most Direct/Hilly").

Alternate Route Display: Based on the elevation tolerance, the application will display multiple route options on the map, highlighting the selected route.

Route Details: For each route, display key metrics:

Total distance

Estimated travel time

Total elevation gain

Total elevation loss

Turn-by-turn directions.

Route Highlighting: Clearly distinguish the currently selected route on the map.

3.2. User Interface Enhancements
Autocomplete for address input.

Clear visual indication of selected route.

Responsive design for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

4. Technical Stack
4.1. Front-End
HTML5: Structure of the web application.

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): Styling and responsive layout.

JavaScript (React.js): Front-end framework for interactive UI components and state management.

Alternative: Plain JavaScript if React proves to be overkill for the initial scope.

Map Library: Google Maps JavaScript API.

4.2. Back-End / APIs
Google Maps Platform APIs:

Directions API: For calculating bicycle routes. This will be the primary API for routing. We will need to explore how to leverage its capabilities (e.g., avoid parameters, route preferences) in conjunction with custom logic for elevation.

Elevation API: To obtain elevation data along routes. This will be crucial for calculating total elevation gain for various route segments.

Places API (Autocomplete): For efficient origin and destination input.

Geocoding API: To convert addresses/place names into geographical coordinates (lat/lng).

5. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX)
5.1. Layout
Header: Application title and logo.

Sidebar/Panel (Left/Top): Contains origin/destination input fields, the elevation tolerance slider, and route options display.

Main Content Area (Right/Bottom): Dominant map display.

Route Details Panel (Collapsible/Toggleable): Displays detailed information (distance, elevation, turn-by-turn) for the selected route.

5.2. Interaction Flow
User enters origin and destination.

Application automatically requests initial route options from Google Maps Directions API.

Initial route(s) displayed on the map.

User adjusts the "Elevation Tolerance" slider.

Application re-calculates or filters routes based on the new tolerance. This might involve:

Making multiple Directions API calls with different parameters (if the API supports elevation-aware routing directly in a granular way beyond 'avoid hills').

More likely, generating several routes and then using the Elevation API to calculate elevation profiles for each, then presenting the best options based on tolerance.

Multiple route options are presented to the user (e.g., as distinct lines on the map and a list in the sidebar).

User selects a route from the options.

Selected route is highlighted, and detailed turn-by-turn directions are displayed.

6. Data Flow
User Input: Origin/Destination (text), Elevation Tolerance (slider value).

Front-End Processing:

Converts text inputs to Lat/Lng using Places/Geocoding API.

Constructs requests for Directions API based on Lat/Lng and elevation tolerance.

(If necessary) Requests elevation data using Elevation API for path segments.

Google Maps API: Returns route polyline, distance, duration, and (potentially) waypoints.

Front-End Rendering:

Draws routes on the map.

Displays route statistics and turn-by-turn directions.

Updates map based on user interactions (pan, zoom).

7. API Integration
7.1. Google Maps Directions API
mode: 'bicycling'

origin, destination: User-provided coordinates.

Key Challenge: The Directions API does not have a direct parameter for "elevation gain tolerance." This will require a custom approach:

Strategy 1 (Multiple Route Requests): Make multiple Directions API calls with slight variations (e.g., using avoid parameters for certain road types or strategically placed waypoints to influence hilliness), and then evaluate each returned route's elevation profile.

Strategy 2 (Post-Processing with Elevation API): Request several alternatives=true routes from the Directions API, and then use the Elevation API to sample points along each alternative route to calculate their total elevation gain. The application would then filter and present these routes to the user based on their tolerance. This is the more probable and robust approach.

7.2. Google Maps Elevation API
Used to get elevation data for specific points or along a path.

path: A polyline representing the route.

samples: Number of elevation samples along the path. Higher samples provide more accurate elevation profiles.

7.3. Google Maps Places API
Used for autocomplete functionality for origin and destination input fields.

8. Elevation Tolerance Mechanism
The "Elevation Tolerance" slider will map to different strategies for route selection:

"Least Hilly": Prioritize routes with the lowest total elevation gain. This will involve analyzing all available alternative routes (from Directions API) using the Elevation API and selecting the one with the minimal ascent.

"Moderate": Balance distance/time with moderate elevation gain. This could involve selecting a route that avoids extreme climbs but doesn't necessarily take the longest flatter path.

"Most Direct / Hilly": Prioritize the most direct route, even if it involves significant climbs. This will generally correspond to the primary route returned by the Directions API.

Implementation Details:

When a user requests directions, query the Directions API for multiple alternative routes (if alternatives parameter is supported and useful here).

For each alternative route (and the main route), pass its polyline to the Elevation API to get a detailed elevation profile.

Calculate the total elevation gain for each route based on its profile.

Based on the user's selected "Elevation Tolerance," filter or rank these routes and display the top 1-3 options.

9. Scalability & Performance Considerations
API Quotas: Be mindful of Google Maps API quotas and implement client-side caching where appropriate (e.g., for frequently requested geocodes if addresses are repeated, though this is less likely for unique routes).

Efficient Route Calculation: Optimize the logic for combining Directions API and Elevation API calls to minimize latency. Requesting too many samples for Elevation API can be slow and costly.

Front-End Performance: Use React's performance optimizations (e.g., memo, useCallback, useMemo) to ensure a smooth UI.

Bundle Size: Keep the JavaScript bundle size optimized for faster initial load times.

10. Security Considerations
API Key Protection: Google Maps API keys should be restricted to the application's domain and IP addresses. For client-side usage, only public-facing keys should be used. Server-side processing for sensitive operations would require more robust key management (not applicable if purely client-side).

Input Validation: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

HTTPS: The application must be served over HTTPS to protect data in transit.

11. Testing Strategy
Unit Tests: For individual React components and utility functions.

Integration Tests: To verify the interaction between different components and API calls.

End-to-End Tests: Simulate user journeys (e.g., entering an address, adjusting slider, viewing route).

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Test on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

Mobile Responsiveness: Test on various mobile devices and screen sizes.

Performance Testing: Measure route calculation times and overall UI responsiveness.

Accuracy Testing: Manually verify route accuracy and elevation gain calculations against known routes.

12. Deployment
The application will be deployed as a static web application on a hosting service (e.g., Firebase Hosting, Netlify, Vercel, or a custom web server).

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated builds and deployments is recommended.

13. Future Enhancements
Favorites/Saved Routes: Allow users to save frequently used routes.

User Profiles: Personalize settings and preferences.

Route Sharing: Option to share routes with others.

Points of Interest: Display bicycle-friendly POIs (e.g., bike shops, repair stations, water fountains).

Weather Overlay: Integrate weather data for route planning.

Advanced Route Customization: Allow users to specify avoid options (e.g., specific roads, heavy traffic areas).

GPX Export: Export route data for use with GPS devices.

Crowd-sourced Data: Integrate user feedback on route conditions (e.g., road quality, hazards).

Real-time Traffic/Construction: Overlay real-time data from Google Maps.
